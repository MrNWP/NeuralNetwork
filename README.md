# NeuralNetwork
A simple back-propagation neural network in C++
The basis for this project was Tariq Rashid and his Python project and book on Neural Networks.
This small project depends on the Eigen library of Matrices to facilitate the matrix math involved.
It also uses Rashid's MNIST files for training and testing.
